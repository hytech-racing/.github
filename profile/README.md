Suppose you sell a product using the RasPi GPIO connector.<p />

How does your customer control the attached hardware?<p />

For a RasPi relay board, how does the user control the relays when the Pi
is located in the attic? End-users might not have a spare display and
keyboard, and a display and keyboard may not be convenient at that location.

The GPIOServer presents a web page interface to the RasPi GPIO lines,
allowing the end user to read inputs and set outputs using any browser.
The GPIO config is specified by a file (that you supply) limiting the
user to valid actions.

The project also supplies an executable to control the GPIO system
directly without a browser. The program can be used at the command line
or embeded into scripts as needed. It can be compiled to run on linux,
windows, or IOS systems.
